# Footer

The "Footer" component is a critical section of a website that appears at the bottom of every page, providing essential information, navigation links, and contact details. It serves as a hub for supplementary content, offering users easy access to important resources and enhancing the overall site experience. The Footer component is typically present across all pages, often featuring on both desktop and mobile views. Key features of the Footer component include:

- Essential Links: The footer often includes links to key pages, such as About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact, and Help/Support, making them easily accessible.
- Contact Information: Itâ€™s common to display phone numbers, email addresses, or a contact form for customer support or inquiries.
- Social Media Icons: The footer frequently includes icons linking to social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), encouraging users to connect or follow the brand.
- Newsletter Sign-Up: A common feature in footers is a subscription form where users can enter their email to receive updates, promotions, or newsletters.
- Copyright and Legal Notices: The footer is often where legal disclaimers, copyright information, and trademarks are listed, providing clarity on the site's legal protections.
- Site Map: Some footers include a site map or quick navigation options, helping users find specific pages or content on the website with ease.

The primary goal of the Footer component is to provide users with important, supplementary information in a structured and easily accessible way, rounding off the user experience and ensuring they can find the resources they need without having to scroll back to the top of the page.
