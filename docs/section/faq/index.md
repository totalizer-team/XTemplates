# FAQ

The "FAQ" (Frequently Asked Questions) component is a dedicated section that addresses common questions or concerns users might have, providing clear and concise answers. This component helps improve user experience by offering instant support and reducing the need for customers to contact support teams. It is commonly found on websites such as product pages, customer service portals, or support sections. The key features of an FAQ component include:

- Clear Question and Answer Format: Questions are listed with corresponding answers, allowing users to quickly find relevant information without unnecessary navigation.
- Accordion or Toggle Functionality: FAQ sections often feature collapsible or expandable sections (accordion-style), making the content easy to browse and keeping the page tidy.
- Searchable Content: Some FAQ components include a search bar, enabling users to quickly type in keywords and find answers to specific questions.
- Categorized Topics: FAQs are often grouped by categories (e.g., Shipping, Payments, Product Info), helping users quickly navigate through common themes and find what they need faster.
  Interactive Features: Some FAQ sections may include interactive elements, such as thumbs-up/down ratings or a “Was this helpful?” prompt, allowing users to provide feedback on the quality of answers.

The primary goal of the FAQ component is to provide quick, accessible information that helps users solve issues or answer questions without needing direct support, improving overall satisfaction and efficiency.
