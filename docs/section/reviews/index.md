# Reviews

The "Reviews" component is designed to showcase customer feedback, ratings, and testimonials, helping to build trust and social proof for a product, service, or brand. It is typically featured on product pages, landing pages, or trust-building sections of websites to give potential customers insight into the experiences of others. The Reviews component helps users feel more confident in their purchasing decisions by highlighting real, positive experiences. Key features of the Reviews component include:

- Customer Ratings: Reviews often include star ratings or numerical scores (e.g., 4.5/5), providing a quick overview of the product's or service's quality based on user feedback.
  \*Textual Testimonials: Written feedback from customers offers more detailed insights into their experiences, highlighting what they liked or found valuable about the product or service.
- Reviewer Information: Many Reviews components include basic details about the reviewer, such as their name, location, or photo, adding authenticity and helping users relate to the feedback.
- Featured Reviews: Positive reviews or high-rated testimonials are often highlighted to attract attention and encourage trust, making them stand out visually.
- Review Filtering: Some components allow users to filter or sort reviews by date, rating, or helpfulness, helping them find the most relevant feedback to their interests.
- Interactive Features: Users can often rate reviews as "helpful" or leave their own feedback, engaging with the content and contributing to the overall community-driven aspect.
- Overall Average Rating: The component often displays an average rating from all collected reviews, giving users a quick snapshot of the overall satisfaction level from previous customers.

The primary goal of the Reviews component is to provide prospective customers with authentic feedback from real users, building confidence and trust by showcasing the value and positive impact of the product, service, or brand.
