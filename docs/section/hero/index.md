# Hero

The "Hero" component is a visually impactful section typically placed at the top of a webpage, designed to make a strong first impression and grab the user’s attention immediately. It often combines bold imagery, compelling messaging, and clear calls to action, setting the tone for the rest of the website. The Hero component is commonly featured on homepages, landing pages, or promotional sections. Key features of the Hero component include:

- Striking Visuals: The Hero section often includes large background images, videos, or animations that captivate users and set the visual theme for the page.
- Headline and Subheading: A bold, concise headline communicates the core message or value proposition, often supported by a subheading to provide additional context or detail.
- Clear Call-to-Action (CTA): Prominent buttons or links encourage users to take immediate action, such as signing up, purchasing, learning more, or starting a free trial.
- Responsive Design: The Hero component is designed to adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Overlay or Text Contrast: To ensure readability, text and buttons may have overlays or high-contrast colors that stand out against background images or videos, making it easy for users to absorb the message.
- Interactive Elements: Some Hero components include interactive features like parallax scrolling or hover effects to add a dynamic, engaging touch.

The primary goal of the Hero component is to immediately capture the user’s attention, convey the key message or offering, and encourage them to take a desired action, creating an engaging entry point to the rest of the site.
