# Hero

The "Hero" component typically refers to a prominent content module commonly found at the top of a webpage, containing important information or visual elements. This module is often used to showcase attention-grabbing content, such as:

* Large background images or videos: Used to attract attention.
* Headings and subheadings: Conveying core messages or themes.
* Call-to-action buttons (CTA): Encouraging users to take specific actions, such as signing up, making a purchase, or learning more.

The "Hero" module aims to create a strong first impression through the combination of visuals and content. Its specific meaning may vary depending on the project and design.
